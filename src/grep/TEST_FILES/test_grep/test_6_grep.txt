Have not the experts and their research contributed all these innovations, their translation into services and goods by
the respective industries, in chemistry and in other fields of science and technology? Coping with limitations in crucial
resources has always been an important driving force for the
growth in chemical knowledge and the achievements of the
chemical industry: Habers and Bosch research on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in the form of ammonia was
triggered by the shortage of natural nitrate, the Chilean salitre. Similar limitations led to coal liquefaction by Fischer
and Tropsch. And a third example is the development of synthetic rubber in the 1930s which eased the dependence of
industry on natural rubber from tropical countries—which at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century had brought great
profits to the traders, but also great suffering to the people of
the countries of origin, for example, the Congo. Today it is not
much different. With challenges such as the peaking of the major feedstock of chemical industry, that is, crude oil, and its
spiraling price as an energy source, research for more efficient
photovoltaic materials is increasingly important.
But what is meant by “sustainability”? Simply carrying
on? A connotation of a “better world” resonates in this word;
and certainly the development meant is not what resulted
from the chemical-industrial progress in the first half of the
twentieth century with its two world wars, the blasting away of
